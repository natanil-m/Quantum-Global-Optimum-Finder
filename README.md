# Quantum Global Minimum Finder (QGMF)

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources related to the Quantum Global Minimum Finder (QGMF) algorithm, a novel approach for efficiently finding the global minimum of complex functions using quantum computing.

## Background

Optimizing complex functions with multiple local minima is a challenging problem. Traditional methods can be slow and often get stuck in local minima. QGMF leverages quantum computing's unique capabilities to explore multiple solution paths simultaneously, potentially offering a significant speedup for optimization problems.

## High-Level Description

QGMF is an iterative quantum algorithm that shifts a function along the y-axis to efficiently search for the global minimum. It employs variational quantum search (VQS) to count negative values and determine the global minimum. The paper (not finished yet) provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm.

## Usage

You can access the code and resources in this repository to implement and run the QGMF algorithm on a quantum computing platform.
